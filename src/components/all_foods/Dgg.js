      sticky sidebar using position sticky. In this lesson: Using position
      sticky Troubleshooting position sticky Setting position sticky Position
      sticky alternates the position of an element between relative and fixed
      based on the viewer’s scroll position. A sticky element is relative to the
      document flow until a defined scroll position is reached, then it switches
      to behaving like a fixed element within its direct parent. Once, the
      sticky element hits the bottom of its parent, it doesn’t scroll past it.
      Position sticky Style panel → Position → Position → Sticky With the
      sidebar selected, apply position sticky in the Style panel. You'll notice
      that if you scroll, the sidebar doesn't stick! It remains in its natural
      place in the document flow. That's because we didn't define a distance
      yet. You must specify at least one position value for the top, bottom,
      left, or right side for sticky positioning to work. This depends on where
      your element is positioned within the parent and how you're scrolling,
      vertically or horizontally. Define a distance from the top. Set the top
      value to 0px if you want the sidebar to stick to the top of the page, or
      set another value, say 30px, to make it stick to the top of the page with
      a distance of 30px from the top. Now, when you scroll, the sidebar should
      stick to the page as long as you're scrolling within the container, the
      direct parent, of the sidebar. Troubleshooting position sticky Sometimes,
      position sticky won't work even though you've set the position to sticky
      and defined a distance value for one of the sides of the element. That can
      happen for many reasons: Position sticky will most probably not work if
      overflow is set to hidden, scroll, or auto on any of the parents of the
      element. Position sticky may not work correctly if any parent element has
      a set height. Many browsers still do not support sticky positioning. Check
      out which browsers support position: sticky. Position sticky may also not
      work if the position distance value is set on a side that isn't affected
      by the scrolling. For example, if you set the distance on the left or
      right, and you're scrolling through the page vertically, the element won't
      stick. Another example would be if you've set a distance to the bottom,
      for instance, instead of the top and your element is aligned to the top of
      the parent — it's either the first element in the parent or aligned to the
      top with flex or grid alignment settings. Sticky to the bottom To keep the
      sidebar sticking to the bottom of the page, define a bottom value and
      change the alignment of the sidebar if it's a flex child or a grid child.
